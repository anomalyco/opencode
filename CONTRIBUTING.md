PR titles should follow conventional commit standards:

- `feat:` new feature or functionality
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation or README changes
- `chore:` maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.
- `refactor:` code refactoring without changing behavior
- `test:` adding or updating tests

You can optionally include a scope to indicate which package is affected:

- `feat(app):` feature in the app package
- `fix(desktop):` bug fix in the desktop package
- `chore(opencode):` maintenance in the opencode package

Examples:

- `docs: update contributing guidelines`
- `fix: resolve crash on startup`
- `feat: add dark mode support`
- `feat(app): add dark mode support`
- `fix(desktop): resolve crash on startup`
- `chore: bump dependency versions`

### Style Preferences

These are not strictly enforced, they are just general guidelines:

- **Functions:** Keep logic within a single function unless breaking it out adds clear reuse or composition benefits.
- **Destructuring:** Do not do unnecessary destructuring of variables.
- **Control flow:** Avoid `else` statements.
- **Error handling:** Prefer `.catch(...)` instead of `try`/`catch` when possible.
- **Types:** Reach for precise types and avoid `any`.
- **Variables:** Stick to immutable patterns and avoid `let`.
- **Naming:** Choose concise single-word identifiers when they remain descriptive.
- **Runtime APIs:** Use Bun helpers such as `Bun.file()` when they fit the use case.

## Feature Requests

For net-new functionality, start with a design conversation. Open an issue describing the problem, your proposed approach (optional), and why it belongs in OpenCode. The core team will help decide whether it should move forward; please wait for that approval instead of opening a feature PR directly.

## Trust & Vouch System

This project uses [vouch](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch) to manage contributor trust. The vouch list is maintained in [`.github/VOUCHED.td`](.github/VOUCHED.td).

### How it works

- **Vouched users** are explicitly trusted contributors.
- **Denounced users** are explicitly blocked. Issues and pull requests from denounced users are automatically closed. If you have been denounced, you can request to be unvouched by reaching out to a maintainer on [Discord](https://opencode.ai/discord)
- **Everyone else** can participate normally — you don't need to be vouched to open issues or PRs.

### For maintainers

Collaborators with write access can manage the vouch list by commenting on any issue:

- `vouch` — vouch for the issue author
- `vouch @username` — vouch for a specific user
- `denounce` — denounce the issue author
- `denounce @username` — denounce a specific user
- `denounce @username <reason>` — denounce with a reason
- `unvouch` / `unvouch @username` — remove someone from the list

Changes are committed automatically to `.github/VOUCHED.td`.

### Denouncement policy

Denouncement is reserved for users who repeatedly submit low-quality AI-generated contributions, spam, or otherwise act in bad faith. It is not used for disagreements or honest mistakes.

## Issue Requirements

All issues **must** use one of our issue templates:

- **Bug report** — for reporting bugs (requires a description)
- **Feature request** — for suggesting enhancements (requires verification checkbox and description)
- **Question** — for asking questions (requires the question)

Blank issues are not allowed. When a new issue is opened, an automated check verifies that it follows a template and meets our contributing guidelines. If an issue doesn't meet the requirements, you'll receive a comment explaining what needs to be fixed and have **2 hours** to edit the issue. After that, it will be automatically closed.

Issues may be flagged for:

- Not using a template
- Required fields left empty or filled with placeholder text
- AI-generated walls of text
- Missing meaningful content

If you believe your issue was incorrectly flagged, let a maintainer know.
