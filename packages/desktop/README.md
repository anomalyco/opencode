# OpenCode Desktop

The OpenCode Desktop app, built with Electron.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Build

Run the `build` script to build the app's JS assets, then `package` to
bundle the assets as an application. The resulting app will be in `dist/`.

```bash
bun run build && bun run package
```

Production builds require a prebuilt V2 CLI distribution. The release workflow supplies the artifact from the same run:

```bash
OPENCODE_CHANNEL=prod OPENCODE_CLI_DIST=/absolute/path/to/packages/cli/dist bun run build
OPENCODE_CHANNEL=prod bun run package
```

Set `OPENCODE_CLI_TARGET` when packaging for a different architecture. The CLI is placed outside `app.asar` in the
application's resources directory, and packaging fails if it is missing.

CLI preparation uses these channel rules:

| Channel                                | Without `OPENCODE_CLI_DIST`    | With `OPENCODE_CLI_DIST`                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`, `local`, unset, or unrecognized | Download the dev CLI           | Download the dev CLI; ignore the distribution |
| `beta`                                 | Download the beta CLI          | Copy the supplied CLI; fail if it is missing  |
| `prod`, `latest`                       | Fail before changing resources | Copy the supplied CLI; fail if it is missing  |

`bun dev` is separate from packaging: it uses local renderer/server mode, the dev app identity, and the CLI source by
default. `bun dev --download-server <version>` instead downloads that CLI version for local development. Neither path
requires `OPENCODE_CLI_DIST` or runs the production prebuild.

## Startup benchmark

`bun run bench:startup` measures a **packaged** build from process spawn to the restored tab being ready and the
renderer going idle, so dev-server and bundling costs are not part of the numbers.

```bash
OPENCODE_CHANNEL=dev bun run build && bunx electron-builder --win --dir --config electron-builder.config.ts
bun run bench:startup -- --runs 5                          # warm service (started once, reused by every launch)
bun run bench:startup -- --runs 5 --profile-main --trace   # + main-process CPU profile, Chromium startup trace
bun run bench:startup -- --seed "%APPDATA%\ai.opencode.desktop.dev"   # restore tabs and drafts from an existing profile
```

The app runs in an isolated home (`%TEMP%\opencode-bench-startup`): its own `%APPDATA%`, XDG directories, OpenCode
database, config and service registration. It never attaches to or restarts the developer's live service.
`--service cold` stops the service before each launch so the desktop has to spawn it; the isolated config directory
gives that service a private port, so it never collides with another OpenCode service on the machine. Milestones (ms since spawn) come from the main log, the renderer's
performance timeline and DOM readiness polled over CDP; raw samples are written to `dist/bench-startup`.
