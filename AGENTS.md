# opencode

AI-powered development tool.

## Workflow
- Use local evidence first.
- For multi-step engineering work, prefer `@swe`, `@plan`, and `@code-vet`.
- Keep changes small and validate with the most relevant checks.

## Key Files
| File/Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `package.json` | Root scripts and workspace config |
| `packages/opencode/` | Main CLI/package |
| `packages/sdk/js/script/build.ts` | JS SDK build |
| `.github/workflows/` | Sync and release automation |

## Bash Commands
```bash
bun --cwd packages/opencode typecheck
bun --cwd packages/opencode test test/installation/installation.test.ts
bun run dev
bun run dev:desktop
```

## Conventions
- Default branch is `dev`; use `dev` or `origin/dev` for diffs.
- This is a personal fork of `anomalyco/opencode`; keep release-channel changes isolated.
- Do not run tests from repo root.
- Prefer Bun and existing repo patterns.

## Personal Fork Operations

- Fork remote: `origin` -> `https://github.com/c0dn/opencode-personal.git`.
- Upstream remote: `upstream` -> `https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode.git`.
- Keep personal patches small and isolated so upstream syncs stay easy.
- Do not rename the binary. Personal releases still install and run as `opencode`.
- Release-channel files are fork-specific: installer/updater use `c0dn/opencode-personal`, package-manager upgrades are blocked, and personal release builds are Linux x64/arm64 only.

## Style Guide

### Destructuring

Avoid unnecessary destructuring. Use dot notation to preserve context.

```ts
// Good
obj.a
obj.b

// Bad
const { a, b } = obj
```

### Imports

- Never alias imports. Do not use `import { foo as bar } from "..."` or renamed imports like `resolve as pathResolve`.
- Never use star imports. Do not use `import * as Foo from "..."` or `import type * as Foo from "..."`.
- If a namespace-style value is needed, import the module's own exported namespace by name, for example `import { Project } from "@opencode-ai/core/project"`, then reference `Project.ID`.
- Prefer dynamic imports for heavy modules that are only needed in selected code paths, especially in startup-sensitive entrypoints. Destructure dynamic import bindings near the top of the narrowest scope that needs them so they read like normal imports. Avoid inline chains such as `await import("./module").then((mod) => mod.value())` or `(await import("./module")).value()`. Keep branch-specific imports inside the branch that needs them to preserve lazy loading.

### Variables

Prefer `const` over `let`. Use ternaries or early returns instead of reassignment.

```ts
// Good
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2

// Bad
let foo
if (condition) foo = 1
else foo = 2
```

### Control Flow

Avoid `else` statements. Prefer early returns.

```ts
// Good
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  return 2
}

// Bad
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  else return 2
}
```

### Complex Logic

When a function has several validation branches or supporting details, make the main function read as the happy path and move supporting details into small helpers below it.

```ts
// Good
export function loadThing(input: unknown) {
  const config = requireConfig(input)
  const metadata = readMetadata(input)
  return createThing({ config, metadata })
}

function requireConfig(input: unknown) {
  ...
}
```

- Keep helpers close to the code they support, below the main export when that improves readability.
- Do not over-abstract simple expressions into many single-use helpers; extract only when it names a real concept like `requireConfig` or `readMetadata`.
- Do not return `Effect` from helpers unless they actually perform effectful work. Synchronous parsing, validation, and option building should stay synchronous.
- Prefer Effect schema helpers such as `Schema.UnknownFromJsonString` and `Schema.decodeUnknownOption` over manual `JSON.parse` wrapped in `Effect.try` when parsing untrusted JSON strings.
- Add comments for non-obvious constraints and surprising behavior, not for obvious assignments or control flow.

### Schema Definitions (Drizzle)

Use snake_case for field names so column names don't need to be redefined as strings.

```ts
// Good
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text().primaryKey(),
  project_id: text().notNull(),
  created_at: integer().notNull(),
})

// Bad
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  projectID: text("project_id").notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at").notNull(),
})
```

## Testing

- Avoid mocks as much as possible
- Test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into tests
- Tests cannot run from repo root (guard: `do-not-run-tests-from-root`); run from package dirs like `packages/opencode`.

## Type Checking

- Always run `bun typecheck` from package directories (e.g., `packages/opencode`), never `tsc` directly.

## V2 Session Core

- Keep durable prompt admission separate from model execution. `SessionV2.prompt(...)` admits one durable `session_input` row before scheduling advisory `SessionExecution.wake(sessionID)` unless `resume: false` requests admit-only behavior. The serialized runner promotes admitted inputs into visible user messages at safe boundaries.
- Reusing a Session ID adopts the existing Session. Reusing a prompt message ID reconciles an exact retry only when Session, prompt, and delivery mode match; conflicting reuse fails. Historical projected prompts lazily synthesize promoted inbox records during exact retry.
- Keep `SessionExecution` process-global and Session-ID based. It discovers placement through the read-side `SessionStore` and `LocationServiceMap.get(session.location)`; no layer should take a Session ID.
- Keep `SessionRunner`, model resolution, tool registry, permissions, and filesystem Location-scoped. Omitted `Location.workspaceID` means implicit-local placement; explicit workspace identity remains reserved for future placement semantics.
- Preserve one explicit `llm.stream(request)` call per provider turn and reload projected history before durable continuation. Do not bridge through legacy `SessionPrompt.loop(...)` or delegate orchestration to an in-memory tool loop.
- Keep local Session drains process-local until clustering is implemented. `SessionRunCoordinator` joins explicit same-Session resumes, coalesces prompt wakeups, and allows different Sessions to run concurrently. Advisory wakes drain eligible durable inbox rows only; post-crash activity recovery requires a separate explicit design before it may retry provider work.
- Keep delivery vocabulary explicit. Prompts steer by default and coalesce into the active activity at the next safe provider-turn boundary. Explicit `queue` inputs open FIFO future activities one at a time after the active activity settles.
- Keep EventV2 replay owner claims separate from clustered Session execution ownership.
