### PM Architecture

This fork implements a 3-tier agent hierarchy:

| Tier | Agent | Depth | Role |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| 1 | **PM** | 0 | Primary agent (build/plan modes). Entry point for all sessions. |
| 2 | **Orchestrator** | 1 | Coordinates complex multi-step tasks. |
| 3 | **Subagents** | 2 | Specialized workers (coder, researcher, etc.). |

**Key Features:**
- PM as primary agent with build/plan mode switching
- Orchestrator agent for multi-step task coordination
- `finish_task` tool for orchestrator → PM handoff
- `pm_state` tool for persistent project state across sessions
- All sessions are interactive (no headless mode)
- Depth-based navigation: `Ctrl+X + ↑/↓` to navigate agent hierarchy

### Quick Start (This Fork)

```bash
bun install
cd packages/opencode && bun run build
# Binary at dist/opencode-win32-x64.exe (Windows)
# or dist/opencode-linux-x64, dist/opencode-darwin-x64
```

---

### Installation (Upstream)

```bash
# YOLO
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Package managers
npm i -g opencode-ai@latest        # or bun/pnpm/yarn
scoop bucket add extras; scoop install extras/opencode  # Windows
choco install opencode             # Windows
brew install anomalyco/tap/opencode # macOS and Linux (recommended, always up to date)
brew install opencode              # macOS and Linux (official brew formula, updated less)
paru -S opencode-bin               # Arch Linux
mise use -g opencode               # Any OS
nix run nixpkgs#opencode           # or github:anomalyco/opencode for latest dev branch
```

> [!TIP]
> Remove versions older than 0.1.x before installing.

### Desktop App (BETA)

OpenCode is also available as a desktop application. Download directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases) or [opencode.ai/download](https://opencode.ai/download).

| Platform              | Download                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `opencode-desktop-darwin-aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel)         | `opencode-desktop-darwin-x64.dmg`     |
| Windows               | `opencode-desktop-windows-x64.exe`    |
| Linux                 | `.deb`, `.rpm`, or AppImage           |

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install --cask opencode-desktop
```

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Agents

This fork restructures the agent hierarchy with PM at the top:

**PM Agent (Primary)**
- Modes: **build** (full access) and **plan** (read-only analysis)
- Switch modes with `Tab` key
- Manages project state via `pm_state` tool

**Orchestrator Agent**
- Invoked by PM for complex multi-step tasks
- Coordinates subagents and manages task flow
- Returns results to PM via `finish_task` tool

**Subagents**
- Specialized workers invoked by Orchestrator
- Examples: coder, researcher, reviewer

Learn more about agents in the [upstream docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents).

### Building on OpenCode

If you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using "opencode" as a part of its name; for example, "opencode-dashboard" or "opencode-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.

### FAQ

#### How is this different from Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out of the box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow OpenCode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.
